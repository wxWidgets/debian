Description: wxBase library (runtime) - non-GUI support classes of wxWidgets toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing to build the
 same program under all supported folders, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs using either Win32 or POSIX threads and much more.
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux,
 FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...), win32, and BeOS.
 .
 This package is only useful for non-GUI apps.  It offers a subset of the
 classes in libwx_gtk=V for use in console apps and daemons.  You do not need
 this package to build or use wxWidgets GUI apps.
