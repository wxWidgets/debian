Description: wxBase library (runtime) - non-GUI support classes of wxWidgets toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing the same
 program to be work for all supported platforms, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs, and much more.
 .
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux,
 FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...), Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X.
 .
 This package is only useful for non-GUI apps.  It offers a subset of the
 classes in libwx_gtk=V for use in console apps and daemons.  You do not need
 this package to build or use wxWidgets GUI apps.

 both with -g for normal debugger tracing and with the __WXDEBUG__ flag which
 provides many internal checks by wxWidgets itself that are not performed on
 apps compiled with the 'release version' libs in the -dev package.
