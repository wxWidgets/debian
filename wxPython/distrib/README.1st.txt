README for wxPython-src-2.9.*.tar.bz2
=====================================


This archive contains the source code and other files for both
wxWidgets and wxPython.  Some things not needed for the build have
been removed in order to minimize the size of the archive and are
available elsewhere.  If you would like to have the complete set of
sources and etc. then please either use a SVN snapshot from
http://wxwindows.org/snapshots/ or do a checkout from the subversion
repository yourself from http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/.  If you
would like to use SVN to get the exact same sources that one of these
tarballs was built from then you can checkout using one of the release
tags in http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxPython/tags/.

For more details about building and installing wxWidgets and wxPython
please see this file::

      wxPython/docs/BUILD.txt


For a log of recent changes check these files::

      docs/changes.txt             (for wxWidgets)
      wxPython/docs/CHANGES.txt    (for wxPython)
